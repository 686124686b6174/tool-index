This is a really nice tool for researching vulnerablilities in software and for PoC or explanations of how they work. The fact that you can combine it with nmap output results
is also really nice.

The online manuel for serach sploit can be found here:  https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit
It also goes over install the tool, so I will not cover it here.

Normal Usage:
  searchsploit TERM
  
Options:
  There are more options for this tool, I will just be covering the main ones that I believe are the best to know.
  
  -u                  This is the update switch. I would say run searchsploit -u at least once a week to make sure you are up to date.
  --exclude='term1'   If you know of some terms you would liek to exclude from the search results this would be the way to do it.
                      Multipule terms can be linked with '|' inbetween each term.
  -m                  Once you find a exploit, you can copy it to your current location using this switch and the numerical name of the exploit.
                      ex:  searchsploit -m 49966.py
  -x                  If you find an exploit that you want to take a look at the file without copying it, this would be how to do that.
                      ex:  searchsploit -x 49966.py
  --namp              One of the cools things is you can load an nmap xml file and do searches on the version numbers of anythign you find.
                      ex:  nmap [host] -sV -oX file.xml
                           searchsploit --namp file.xml
                           
Some very import notes from the manuel:
  Note, SearchSploit uses an AND operator, not an OR operator. The more terms that are used, the more results will be filtered out.
  Pro Tip: Do not use abbreviations (use SQL Injection, not SQLi).
  Pro Tip: If you are not receiving the expected results, try searching more broadly by using more general terms (use Kernel 2.6 or Kernel 2.x, not Kernel 2.6.25).
