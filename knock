A good source for learning what port knocking is and how to set it up can be found on the following article:
https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2017/10/04/how-to-secure-ssh-server-using-port-knocking-on-ubuntu-linux

This text will focus on how to use it for CTF/Pentesting. The normal format for using it will be:
knock port1 port2 port3 ....

Optional switches are:
    -u, --udp             make all ports hits use UDP (default is TCP)
    -d, --delay <t>       wait <t> milliseconds between port hits
    -v, --verbose         be verbose
    -V, --version         display version
    -h, --help            display help
    
Example uses:
     knock p1 p2 p3                 normal usage        
     knock -u p1 p2 p3              all knock will be udp instead on tcp
     knock p1:tcp p2:udp p3:tcp     1st and 3rd ports will be tcp while 2nd port will be udp
     knock -d 10 p1 p2 p3           knock will wait 10 milliseconds inbetween port knocks
